This repository contains an implementation of the simulation environment
described in the paper
["Beyond Pick-and-Place: Tackling robotic stacking of diverse shapes"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=U0Q8CrtBJxJ).
Note that this is a re-implementation of the environment (to remove dependencies
on internal libraries). As a result, not all the features described in the paper
are available at this point. Noticeably, domain randomization is not included
in this release. We also aim to  provide reference performance metrics of
trained policies on this environment in the near future.

In this environment, the agent controls a robot arm with a parallel gripper
above a basket, which contains three objects â€” one red, one green, and one blue,
hence the name RGB. The agent's task is to stack the red object on top of the
blue object, within 20 seconds, while the green object serves as an obstacle and
distraction. The agent controls the robot using a 4D Cartesian controller. The
controlled DOFs are x, y, z and rotation around
the z axis. The simulation is a MuJoCo environment built using the
[Modular Manipulation (MoMa) framework](https://github.com/deepmind/robotics/tree/main/py/moma/README.md).


## Corresponding method
The RGB-stacking paper
["Beyond Pick-and-Place: Tackling robotic stacking of diverse shapes"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=U0Q8CrtBJxJ)
also contains a description and thorough evaluation of our initial solution to
both the 'Skill Mastery' (training on the 5 designated test triplets and
evaluating on them) and the 'Skill Generalization' (training on triplets of
training objects and evaluating on the 5 test triplets). Our
approach was to first train a state-based policy in simulation via a standard RL
algorithm (we used [MPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06920)) followed by
interactive distillation of the state-based policy into a vision-based policy (using a
domain randomized version of the environment) that we then deployed to the robot
via zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. We finally improved the policy further via
offline RL based on data collected from the sim-to-real policy (we used [CRR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15134)). For details on our method and the results
please consult the paper.

## Installing and visualizing the environment

Please ensure that you have a working
[MuJoCo200 installation](https://www.roboti.us/index.html) and a valid
[MuJoCo licence](https://www.roboti.us/license.html).

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deepmind/rgb_stacking.git
    cd rgb_stacking
    ```

2. Prepare a Python 3 environment - venv is recommended.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv rgb_stacking_venv
   source rgb_stacking_venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the environment viewer:

   ```bash
   python -m rgb_stacking.main
   ```

Step 2-4 can also be done by running the run.sh script:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

## Specifying the object triplet

The default environment will load with Triplet 4 (see Sect. 3.2.1 in the
paper). If you wish to use a different triplet you can use the following
commands:

   ```python
   from rgb_stacking import environment

   env = environment.rgb_stacking(object_triplet=NAME_OF_SET)
   ```

The possible `NAME_OF_SET` are:

* `rgb_test_triplet{i}` where `i` is one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: Loads test triplet `i`.
* `rgb_test_random`: Randomly loads one of the 5 test triplets.
* `rgb_train_random`: Triplet comprised of blocks from the training set.
* `rgb_heldout_random`: Triplet comprised of blocks from the held-out set.

For more information on the blocks and the possible options, please refer to
the [rgb_objects repository](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_robotics/tree/main/py/manipulation/props/rgb_objects/README.md).

## Specifying the observation space

By default, the observations exposed by the environment are only the ones we
used for training our state-based agents. To use another set of observations
please use the following code snippet:

   ```python
   from rgb_stacking import environment

   env = environment.rgb_stacking(
       observations=environment.ObservationSet.CHOSEN_SET)
   ```

The possible `CHOSEN_SET` are:

* `STATE_ONLY`: Only the state observations, used for training expert policies
    from state in simulation (stage 1).
* `VISION_ONLY`: Only image observations.
* `ALL`: All observations.
* `INTERACTIVE_IMITATION_LEARNING`: Pair of image observations and a subset of
    proprioception observations, used for interactive imitation learning
    (stage 2).
* `OFFLINE_POLICY_IMPROVEMENT`:  Pair of image observations and a subset of
    proprioception observations, used for the one-step offline policy
    improvement (stage 3).

## Real RGB-Stacking Environment: CAD models and assembly instructions

The [CAD model](https://deepmind.onshape.com/documents/d0b99322019b124525012b2a/w/6702310a5b51c79efed7c65b/e/4b6eb89dc085468d0fee5e97)
of the setup is available in onshape.

We also provide the following [documents](https://github.com/deepmind/rgb_stacking/tree/main/real_cell_documentation)
for the assembly of the real cell:

  * Assembly instructions for the basket.
  * Assembly instructions for the robot.
  * Assembly instructions for the cell.
  * The bill of materials of all the necessary parts.
  * A diagram with the wiring of cell.

The RGB-objects themselves can be 3D-printed using the STLs available in the [rgb_objects repository](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_robotics/tree/main/py/manipulation/props/rgb_objects/README.md).
